## What is Vibecoding?

**Vibecoding** is a new paradigm of developing with AI, coined by Andrej Karpathy (former Tesla AI Director).

```
Traditional Coding:
You → Learn syntax → Write code → Debug → Software

Vibecoding:
You → Express intent → AI writes code → Refine together → Software
```

### The 3-Step Cycle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│   1. Express Intent  →  2. Check Result  →  3. Refine  │
│         ↑                                      │       │
│         └──────────────────────────────────────┘       │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Express Intent**: Tell Claude what you want in natural language
2. **Check Result**: See if it matches your expectations
3. **Refine**: Give feedback to improve

Repeat until perfect. No syntax memorization needed.

<details>
<summary><strong>See Vibecoding in Action</strong></summary>

### Example: Making a Webpage

**Traditional coding (hours of learning required):**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: sans-serif; }
        h1 { color: blue; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

**Vibecoding (30 seconds):**
```
You: Make a webpage with a blue heading that says 'Hello'
Claude: [creates the file instantly]
You: Make the heading bigger and center it
Claude: [updates the file]
```

The AI handles syntax. You focus on **what** you want, not **how** to code it.

## Why Claude Code?

> **"There's Google Jules, Cursor, Windsurf... Why Claude Code?"**

| Criteria | Claude Code | Other Tools |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Terminal Native** | ✅ CLI-based, works anywhere | Often IDE-dependent |
| **Transparent Operation** | ✅ Shows every action explicitly | Sometimes black-box |
| **Learning Value** | ✅ Learn principles as you go | Convenience can hide fundamentals |
| **Extensibility** | ✅ Hooks, MCP, Skills, etc. | Varies by tool |
| **Cost** | ✅ Pay for what you use (API) | Mostly subscription-based |

> 💡 **Future Plans**: We plan to expand curricula for Cursor, Windsurf, Jules, and other tools.

**Compatibility Note**: Core concepts learned here (prompting, debugging, project structure) apply to ANY AI coding tool.

## Learning Guide

### How to Proceed

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ✅ Start from [your level](#audience), proceed in order | ❌ Jump to the middle without prior knowledge |
| ✅ Ask Claude directly, check the results | ❌ Just read without executing |
| ✅ Give feedback when results differ | ❌ Give up if first result isn't perfect |
| ✅ Ask Claude "why?" when stuck | ❌ Ignore error messages |

> 💡 **Vibecoding Tip**: You don't need to type code yourself!
> **Describe** what you want to Claude, check the result, and give feedback.

### When You're Stuck

1. **Ask Claude**: "What is this?", "Why does this error happen?"
2. **Check the Glossary**: [GLOSSARY.md](./GLOSSARY.md)
3. **Ask the Community**: [Discord](https://discord.gg/TxbJ56hS94)
4. **Review previous chapter**: Often the answer is there

### Common Beginner Mistakes

| Mistake | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Vague prompts ("fix bug") | Be specific (file, error, context) |
| Expecting perfection first try | Iterate with feedback |
| Not reading error messages | Copy-paste to Claude |
| Skipping chapters | Each chapter builds on previous |

---

## Pro Tips

From the Claude Code team and experienced developers:

### Essential Tips

1. **Start in Plan mode** - `Shift+Tab` twice. Let Claude think first.
2. **Specify verification** - "Run tests after changes"
3. **Review AI code** - Same standards as human code
4. **Commit CLAUDE.md to Git** - Update when Claude makes mistakes
5. **Use multiple terminals** - Parallel work for complex tasks

### Claude Code vs Web Chat

| Feature | Web Chat | Claude Code |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| File access | ❌ Copy-paste | ✅ Direct read/write |
| Command execution | ❌ Manual | ✅ Automatic |
| Project context | ❌ Explain each time | ✅ Understands structure |
| Continuous work | ❌ Session-based | ✅ Persistent |

**TL;DR**: Web chat is a consultant. Claude Code is a pair programmer in your terminal.
