## What is Vibecoding?

**Vibecoding** is a new paradigm of developing with AI, coined by Andrej Karpathy (former Tesla AI Director).

```
Traditional Coding:
You → Learn syntax → Write code → Debug → Software

Vibecoding:
You → Express intent → AI writes code → Refine together → Software
```

### The 3-Step Cycle

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                         │
│   1. Express Intent  →  2. Check Result  →  3. Refine  │
│         ↑                                      │       │
│         └──────────────────────────────────────┘       │
│                                                         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

1. **Express Intent**: Tell Claude what you want in natural language
2. **Check Result**: See if it matches your expectations
3. **Refine**: Give feedback to improve

Repeat until perfect. No syntax memorization needed.

### Example: Making a Webpage

**Traditional coding (hours of learning required):**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Page</title>
    <style>
        body { font-family: sans-serif; }
        h1 { color: blue; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Hello</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

**Vibecoding (30 seconds):**
```
You: Make a webpage with a blue heading that says 'Hello'
Claude: [creates the file instantly]
You: Make the heading bigger and center it
Claude: [updates the file]
```

The AI handles syntax. You focus on **what** you want, not **how** to code it.

## Learning Guide

### How to Proceed

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ✅ Complete chapters in order | ❌ Skip ahead |
| ✅ Type and run code yourself | ❌ Just read passively |
| ✅ Understand deeply before moving on | ❌ Rush through |
| ✅ Ask Claude when stuck | ❌ Give up after first error |

### When You're Stuck

1. **Ask Claude**: "What is this?", "Why does this error happen?"
2. **Check the Glossary**: [GLOSSARY.md](./GLOSSARY.md)
3. **Ask the Community**: [Discord](https://discord.gg/your-invite-link)
4. **Review previous chapter**: Often the answer is there

### Common Beginner Mistakes

| Mistake | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Vague prompts ("fix bug") | Be specific (file, error, context) |
| Expecting perfection first try | Iterate with feedback |
| Not reading error messages | Copy-paste to Claude |
| Skipping chapters | Each chapter builds on previous |

---

## Pro Tips

From the Claude Code team and experienced developers:

### Essential Tips

1. **Start in Plan mode** - `Shift+Tab` twice. Let Claude think first.
2. **Specify verification** - "Run tests after changes"
3. **Review AI code** - Same standards as human code
4. **Commit CLAUDE.md to Git** - Update when Claude makes mistakes
5. **Use multiple terminals** - Parallel work for complex tasks

### Claude Code vs Web Chat

| Feature | Web Chat | Claude Code |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| File access | ❌ Copy-paste | ✅ Direct read/write |
| Command execution | ❌ Manual | ✅ Automatic |
| Project context | ❌ Explain each time | ✅ Understands structure |
| Continuous work | ❌ Session-based | ✅ Persistent |

**TL;DR**: Web chat is a consultant. Claude Code is a pair programmer in your terminal.
