# Vibecoding Curriculum

> A systematic learning curriculum for AI-native development

**Built with [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)** | [한국어](./README.ko.md) | **English**

**GitHub**: [Hashed-Vibe-School/VibecodingCurriculum](https://github.com/Hashed-Vibe-School/VibecodingCurriculum)

> **Updated for Claude Code v2.1.1**

## What is Vibecoding?

**Vibecoding** is a new paradigm of software development where you collaborate with AI as a thinking partner, not just a code generator. It's about:

- **Expressing intent** rather than writing every line
- **Iterating through conversation** instead of debugging alone
- **Building systems** with AI as your pair programmer
- **Shipping faster** while maintaining quality

This curriculum teaches Vibecoding through Claude Code—Anthropic's official CLI tool that brings AI-assisted development directly to your terminal.

## Our Mission

**Empowering early builders for faster transitions in the AI era—and growing together.**

The AI landscape is evolving rapidly. Developers who can effectively leverage AI tools will lead the next wave of innovation. This curriculum exists to:

- **Accelerate your transition** into AI-assisted development
- **Build practical skills** through hands-on projects, not just theory
- **Create a community** of builders who learn and grow together

## Building Capability, Not Just Coding Skills

This curriculum is not about learning to write code with AI—it's about **developing the capability to build**.

| Traditional Coding Skills | Building Capability |
|---------------------------|---------------------|
| Write code that works | Design systems that scale |
| Fix bugs | Prevent bugs through architecture |
| Learn syntax | Understand problem domains |
| Use tools | Create tools and workflows |
| Follow patterns | Establish patterns for teams |

### Builder Mindset

1. **Think in systems**: See connections between components, not just individual files
2. **Automate relentlessly**: Build workflows that multiply your output
3. **Document for humans**: Create knowledge that outlasts memory
4. **Ship iteratively**: Done is better than perfect; improve continuously
5. **Teach while learning**: Share knowledge to solidify understanding

### Why Claude Code for Building?

Claude Code is not just autocomplete—it's a **building partner**:
- Explores codebases to understand context
- Executes multi-step tasks autonomously
- Integrates with your entire development ecosystem
- Learns your project's rules and patterns

## Overview

This curriculum is designed to help you systematically learn AI-assisted development using Claude Code. Through 11 chapters, you'll progress step-by-step from fundamentals to advanced applications.

## Philosophy

> "It's more important to know one thing deeply and accurately than to know many things superficially."

Each chapter focuses on mastering concepts through hands-on practice, not just reading documentation.

### Learning Principles

- **Build real things**: Every chapter ends with something you can use
- **Understand the why**: Know not just how, but when to use each feature
- **Iterate quickly**: Start rough, improve fast
- **Stay current**: This field moves fast—update regularly

## Pro Tips

We've gathered tips from the Claude Code team and pragmatic developers. (s/o [@bcherny](https://x.com/bcherny))

1. **"Almost always start in Plan mode"** - Press `Shift+Tab` twice. Let Claude explore and plan before making changes.

2. **"Give Claude a way to verify its work"** - The most important tip. Ask Claude to run tests, check types, or validate output.

3. **"Hold the same bar for Claude's code as human code"** - Review AI-generated code with the same rigor.

4. **"Share CLAUDE.md in git"** - Update it whenever Claude does something wrong.

5. **"Run multiple Claudes in parallel"** - For complex tasks, use multiple terminal sessions.
