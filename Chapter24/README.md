# Chapter 24: Team Collaboration

**English** | [한국어](./README.ko.md)

## What You Will Learn

- Standardizing Claude Code in teams
- Sharing settings and prompts
- Building collaboration workflows

---

## Why Learn Team Collaboration?

Using alone vs in a team is different:

- **Consistency**: Different approaches per member → confusion
- **Onboarding**: New members should start immediately
- **Quality**: Improve code quality across the team

## Team Standardization

### What to Share
