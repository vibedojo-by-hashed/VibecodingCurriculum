---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and logged in
- Understanding of effective prompting (Chapter 08)

---

## 🔗 Connection to Previous Chapter

In Chapter 08, you learned effective prompting. Now let's use those skills to **explore** and **understand** codebases. The ability to read and understand code is just as important as the ability to write code!

---

## Why is Code Exploration Important?

Imagine your first day at a new job. The codebase has thousands of files. Reading everything would take weeks. But you need to fix a bug today.

This is where code exploration with Claude shines. Instead of manually hunting through folders, just ask Claude to find what you need.

**Real-world scenarios:**
- You inherited a project and need to understand how it works
- There's a bug somewhere but you don't know which file to look at
- You want to add a feature but need to find similar code to reference
- You're reviewing someone's code and need to understand the context
- You need to maintain legacy code

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> **Think of Claude as your code tour guide:**
> - Without Claude: Wandering through unfamiliar streets looking for a restaurant
> - With Claude: Having a local friend who knows exactly where everything is
>
> You don't need to read all the code yourself.
> Ask Claude and it will identify the key points and explain them.

## The Importance of Code Reading

### Why is Code Reading Important?

Developers **spend more time reading code than writing it**.

| Activity | Time Percentage |
|----------|-----------------|
| Reading/understanding code | 60-70% |
| Writing code | 20-30% |
| Debugging/testing | 10-20% |

The ability to quickly understand code equals productivity!

### Effective Code Reading Strategies

#### 1. Top-Down Approach

Start by grasping the big picture, then dive into details.

```
Step 1: Understand project overview
> What is this project? Explain in one sentence.

Step 2: Understand structure
> Show me the folder structure. Explain each folder's role.

Step 3: Find entry point
> Where does the app start? What's the main file?

Step 4: Explore specific features
> How is the login feature implemented?
```

#### 2. Feature-based Approach

Follow and understand the feature you're interested in.

```
> What happens when the user clicks the button?
> Where does the data flow from and to?
> Where does this API call start and end?
```

#### 3. Backward Tracing Approach

Start from the result and trace back to the cause.

```
> Where is this screen rendered?
> Where does this error message come from?
> Where does this data come from?
```

> 🔥 **Pro Tip**
>
> **The 80/20 Rule of Code Reading:**
>
> **20% of the code** handles **80% of the functionality** in a project.
> Identify that core 20% first.
>
> Questions to find the core:
> - "What are the 5 most important files?"
> - "Where is the business logic?"
> - "How are user requests processed?"

## Search Tools: Glob and Grep

Claude Code uses two powerful search tools.

### Glob: Find by File Name

Glob searches for files by name using **patterns**.

#### Basic Patterns

| Pattern | Meaning | Example |
|---------|---------|---------|
| `*.js` | Files ending in .js | app.js, utils.js |
| `*.{ts,tsx}` | .ts or .tsx files | Button.tsx, api.ts |
| `**/*.js` | .js files in all folders | src/app.js, lib/utils.js |
| `src/**/*` | All files in src | src/..., src/components/... |
| `**/test*` | Files starting with test | test.js, testing.md |
| `**/*config*` | Files containing config | tsconfig.json, vite.config.ts |

#### Glob Usage Examples

```
# Find JavaScript/TypeScript files
> Find all TypeScript files in this project

# Find test files
> Where are the test files?
> Find files ending in .test.ts or .spec.ts

# Find config files
> Find all files with config in the name

# Find in specific folder
> Find all .tsx files in src/components
```

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> **You don't need to memorize patterns!**
>
> Make natural language requests and Claude converts them to appropriate patterns.
> Just say "Find files related to Button" and it works.

### Grep: Find in File Contents

Grep searches for text inside file **contents**.

#### Grep Usage Examples

```
# Find specific function
> Where is the "handleSubmit" function defined?

# Find specific text
> Find all "TODO" comments

# Find specific patterns
> Find all places with console.log remaining

# Find API endpoints
> Find all code containing "/api/"

# Find error messages
> Where does the "User not found" message come from?
```

#### Advanced Grep Patterns

```
# Find function definitions
> Find where "function fetchUser" is defined

# Find import statements
> Find all files that import useState

# Find variable usage
> Find all places that use the isLoading variable

# Regex patterns (advanced)
> Find regex that validates email format
```

### Glob vs Grep Comparison

| Characteristic | Glob | Grep |
|----------------|------|------|
| Search target | File names | File contents |
| Use case | "Find Button.tsx" | "Where is handleClick called?" |
| Question type | "What files exist?" | "Where is this code?" |

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> **node_modules is excluded from searches.**
>
> Installed package code is not included in search results.
> This is intentional. It prevents thousands of unnecessary results.

---

## Understanding Project Structure

### Asking About Overall Structure

```
> Explain this project structure
```

Claude analyzes the folder structure and key files to explain.

```
> What does this project do?
```

Analyzes README.md and code to tell you the purpose.

```
> What tech stack is being used?
```

Analyzes package.json and config files to tell you the tech stack.

### Looking at Specific Folders

```
> @src/ What's inside this folder?
```

```
> What's the role of the components folder?
```

```
> What custom hooks are in the hooks folder?
```

### Understanding Entry Points and Flow

```
# Where the app starts
> What's the entry point of this app?
> Find the main function or index file

# Routing structure
> Explain the routing structure of this app
> What pages exist?

# Data flow
> How does user data flow?
> From API call to screen display
```

---

## Exploration Workflow

A systematic order for understanding new projects.

### 5-Step Exploration Workflow

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Step 1: Project Overview                                    |
|  > What is this project? Explain briefly.                    |
|  > What's the tech stack?                                    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Step 2: Folder Structure                                    |
|  > Show folder structure and explain each folder's role.     |
|  > What are the 3 most important folders?                    |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Step 3: Entry Point                                         |
|  > Where does this app start? What's the main file?          |
|  > Explain the scripts in package.json                       |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Step 4: Core Files                                          |
|  > Tell me the 5 most important files                        |
|  > Where is the business logic?                              |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Step 5: Specific Features                                   |
|  > How is [feature of interest] implemented?                 |
|  > Find related files and explain.                           |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Practical Application Example

```
# Step 1: Overview
> What is this project?

Claude: This project is a blog platform built with Next.js.
You can write posts in Markdown, and it supports tag-based categorization and search.

# Step 2: Structure
> Explain the folder structure

Claude:
src/
├── app/          # Next.js App Router (pages)
├── components/   # UI components
├── lib/          # Utility functions
├── content/      # Markdown post files
└── styles/       # CSS styles

# Step 3: Entry point
> Where's the main page?

Claude: src/app/page.tsx is the main page.
It displays the list of recent posts.

# Step 4: Core files
> Tell me the 5 most important files

Claude:
1. src/app/page.tsx - Main page
2. src/lib/posts.ts - Post data processing
3. src/components/PostCard.tsx - Post card UI
4. src/app/posts/[slug]/page.tsx - Post detail page
5. src/lib/markdown.ts - Markdown parsing

# Step 5: Specific feature
> How is the search feature implemented?

Claude: The search page is at @src/app/search/page.tsx.
@src/lib/search.ts implements fuzzy search using Fuse.js.
The search index is generated at build time.
```

## Safe Exploration with Plan Mode

Use Plan mode when you want to explore without changing files.

```
> /plan
> Analyze this project. Don't modify, just explain.
```

### What You Can Do in Plan Mode

| Action | Plan Mode | Normal Mode |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| Reading files | O | O |
| Analyzing structure | O | O |
| Modifying files | X | O |
| Running commands | X | O |
| Creating files | X | O |

### Plan Mode Usage Examples

```
> /plan
> Analyze this project's architecture.
> What patterns are being used.
> Are there areas for improvement.
> Just analyze, don't modify.

Claude: [Provides detailed analysis]
Architecture analysis:
1. Current pattern: Feature-based structure
2. State management: Using React Query
3. Styling: Tailwind CSS
...

Improvement suggestions:
1. Need to strengthen type safety
2. Lack of consistency in error handling
...

[Analysis complete without modifying any files]
```

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> **When Plan mode is useful:**
>
> - When analyzing a project for the first time
> - When reviewing someone else's code
> - Before deciding what to modify
> - When you don't want to accidentally change files

## Navigating Large Codebases

Strategies for when projects are large.

### Limiting Scope

```
# If the entire project is too large
> Only analyze the src/auth/ folder

# Focus on specific feature
> Only find payment-related code

# Specific file types only
> Among TypeScript files, find ones with "user" in the name
```

### Asking Step by Step

```
# Don't read everything at once, gradually
> First, just show me the folder structure.
[Check result]

> Among those, I'll look at the api folder in detail.
[Check result]

> Explain the api/users.ts file.
[Check result]

> In this file, explain the createUser function.
```

### Identify Core First

```
# Start with what's important
> Tell me only the 5 most core files in this project

# Frequently modified files
> Based on git log, tell me the most frequently modified files

# Files with many dependencies
> Find files that are imported by other files the most
```

> 🔥 **Pro Tip**
>
> **Large project navigation strategy:**
>
> 1. **Read README first**: Understand project overview
> 2. **Check package.json**: Understand technologies used
> 3. **Find entry point**: Understand where app starts
> 4. **Focus on area of interest**: Don't need to see everything
> 5. **Gradually expand**: Broaden scope when needed

---

## Exploration Patterns for Specific Situations

### When Finding Bugs

```
> Where does this error message come from?
> Search for "User not found" message

> Find all places that call this function
> List files that use the fetchUser function

> Find where this state changes
> Find all places where isAuthenticated value changes
```

### When Adding Features

```
> Is there similar functionality somewhere?
> How are other API endpoints implemented?

> Find a reference component
> Show me form component examples

> Should I follow this pattern?
> How do I make it consistent with existing code?
```

### When Reviewing Code

```
> Explain the relationship between files changed in this PR

> Could this change affect other places?
> Find places that might have side effects

> What about test coverage?
> Is there code that tests this function?
```

### When Refactoring

```
> Find duplicate code
> Is there similar logic in multiple places?

> Find unused code
> Are there files not imported anywhere?

> Find high-complexity functions
> Are there functions over 50 lines?
```

## Real Conversation Examples

### Example 1: Exploring a New Project

```
> /plan
> Give me a 1-minute summary of this project.
> What is it? What are the main files?

Claude: This project is a todo management web application.

Tech stack:
- Next.js 14 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Prisma (database)
- Tailwind CSS

Main files:
1. src/app/page.tsx - Main page (todo list)
2. src/components/TodoItem.tsx - Individual todo component
3. src/lib/db.ts - Database connection
4. src/app/api/todos/route.ts - API endpoint

How to run: npm run dev
```

### Example 2: Exploring Specific Features

```
> Find authentication-related code

Claude: Found authentication-related files:

File list:
- src/lib/auth.ts (authentication logic)
- src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts (NextAuth setup)
- src/components/LoginForm.tsx (login form)
- src/components/SignupForm.tsx (signup form)
- src/middleware.ts (authentication middleware)

Authentication method: Using NextAuth.js
Supported providers: Google, GitHub, Email
Session storage: JWT method
```

### Example 3: Bug Location Tracking

```
> Where does the "Cannot add to cart" error message come from?

Claude: Found the error message.

Location: src/lib/cart.ts (line 42)

Code:
```typescript
if (product.stock < quantity) {
  throw new Error("Cannot add to cart");
}
```

This error occurs when trying to add more quantity than the product's stock.

Call path:
1. src/components/ProductCard.tsx (addToCart button click)
2. src/hooks/useCart.ts (addItem function)
3. src/lib/cart.ts (validateStock function) <- Error occurs here
```

### Example 4: Tracing Code Flow

```
> What happens when the user clicks the login button?
> Explain the entire flow

Claude: Traced the login flow:

1. Button click (src/components/LoginForm.tsx)
   └─ handleSubmit function called

2. API request (src/lib/api/auth.ts)
   └─ POST /api/auth/login called

3. Server processing (src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts)
   └─ Email/password verification
   └─ JWT token generation

4. Response processing (src/lib/api/auth.ts)
   └─ Token saved to cookie

5. State update (src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx)
   └─ user state updated
   └─ isAuthenticated = true

6. UI update (src/components/Header.tsx)
   └─ Login button → Changes to profile menu

Related files: 7, entire flow takes about 0.5 seconds
```

## 🚨 Common Errors and Solutions

### Error 1: "File not found"

**Situation:** Claude can't find a file that definitely exists

**Cause:**
- Not in the correct directory
- File name is different than expected

**Solution:**
```
> Which folder are we in now?
> Find files with Button in the name in the current folder
> Search case-insensitively
```

### Error 2: "Too many results"

**Situation:** Over 100 search results

**Cause:**
- Search scope is too broad

**Solution:**
```
# Narrow scope
> Find only Button files inside the components folder
> Search only in .ts files
> Search only inside the src folder
```

### Error 3: "Can't access project"

**Situation:** Claude can't read project files

**Cause:**
- Claude Code not run from inside the project folder

**Solution:**
```bash
cd /path/to/project
claude
```

### Error 4: "Exploration takes too long"

**Situation:** Very slow responses

**Cause:**
- Project is too large
- Request scope is too broad

**Solution:**
```
# Instead of "everything", be specific
> Just analyze the src folder, not the entire project
> Tell me just the 5 most important files, not all files
```

---

## ❌ Common Mistakes

### 1. Trying to Understand Everything at Once

```
# Bad
> Explain every file in this project

# Good
> First, just show me the folder structure.
> Then I'll pick which part to explore.
```

### 2. Not Using Plan Mode

```
# Risky - Claude might try to "fix" things it finds
> Analyze this project and fix any issues

# Safe - Read only
> /plan
> Analyze this project. Just explain, don't change anything.
```

### 3. Vague Search Requests

```
# Bad
> Find the function

# Good
> Find where the "handleLogin" function is defined
```

### 4. Ignoring Project Context

```
# Bad (in a Python project)
> Find all .js files

# Good
> First, tell me what type of project this is.
> Then find the main source files.
```

### 5. Going Too Deep

```
# Bad
> Trace all dependencies of this function to 10 levels deep

# Good
> Just tell me the functions this function directly calls
> I'll go deeper if needed
```

## 🆘 If It Doesn't Work?

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Can't find file | Check folder location, use more specific name |
| Too many results | Narrow search scope, limit to folder |
| Too slow | Limit scope, "core 5" instead of "everything" |
| Structure is complex | Top-down approach, explore one area at a time |
| Code doesn't make sense | "Explain so a beginner can understand" |
