## What You Will Learn in This Chapter

- Standardizing Claude Code in teams
- Sharing settings and prompts
- Building collaboration workflows
- Automating new member onboarding
- Documenting team rules
- **Complete curriculum summary**
- **Next learning steps guide**

---

## Why is Team Collaboration Important?

### Real Scenario: Solo vs Team

**When using alone:**
```
Me: "Review this code"
Claude: (Reviews in each person's own style)
```

**When using in a team:**
```
Team member A: "/review" → Standardized review process
Team member B: "/review" → Same review process
Team member C: "/review" → Same review process

Result: Consistent code quality!
```

### Problems Without Standardization

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Chaos in a Non-Standardized Team                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Team member A: "Claude, review this code"
        → Uses their own prompt
        → Gets feedback in their own style

Team member B: "Is this code okay?"
        → Uses a different prompt
        → Gets feedback in different style

Team member C: "@reviewer please review"
        → Yet another prompt
        → Yet another style

New member: "...what am I supposed to do? 😰"

Results:
- Inconsistent code quality
- Difficult onboarding for new members
- Different experiences per team member
- Failed knowledge sharing
```

### What Changes with Standardization

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Collaboration in a Standardized Team             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Team member A: "/review"
Team member B: "/review"
Team member C: "/review"
New member: "/review" (Can use from day one!)

All get the same:
✓ Review perspective
✓ Feedback style
✓ Quality standards
✓ Documentation approach

Results:
- Consistent code quality
- Fast onboarding
- Improved team-wide productivity
- Automatic knowledge sharing
```

## Why Do You Need This?

**Real scenario**: Your team loves Claude Code, but everyone uses it differently. One person uses certain commands, another has different settings. New team members are confused. Code reviews are inconsistent.

Standardizing Claude Code for your team means everyone works the same way, and it's easier to onboard new members.

### Simple Analogy: Team Playbook

Think of team configuration like a sports team playbook:
- Everyone knows the same plays (commands)
- Everyone uses the same terminology (agents)
- New players can learn quickly (onboarding)

### Another Analogy: McDonald's Manual

The reason you can eat a Big Mac with the same taste at any McDonald's in the world:
- **Standardized recipes** = CLAUDE.md (project rules)
- **Standardized procedures** = Commands (work processes)
- **Role definitions** = Agents (expert roles)
- **Training manuals** = Onboarding documents

If you standardize your team's Claude Code usage the same way, **anyone who uses it gets consistent results**!

## 💡 Tips for Non-Technical Readers

> **Why is "standardization" important?**
>
> Using cooking as an example:
>
> **Without standardization:**
> - Chef A: A pinch of salt
> - Chef B: Two tablespoons of salt
> - Chef C: Salt... did I add it?
> → Different taste every time!
>
> **With standardization:**
> - All chefs: 5g of salt per recipe
> → Same taste every time!
>
> Code is the same way. When the entire team follows the same "recipe":
> - Consistent code style
> - Uniform review quality
> - Easy adaptation for new members

---

## Why Learn Team Collaboration?

Using alone vs in a team is different:

- **Consistency**: Different approaches per member → confusion
- **Onboarding**: New members should start immediately
- **Quality**: Improve code quality across the team

### Individual Use vs Team Use Comparison

| Aspect | Individual Use | Team Use |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Settings | Personal preference | Team standards needed |
| Commands | Only I need to know | Everyone must be able to use |
| Agents | Freely defined | Roles clearly defined |
| Documentation | Optional | Essential! |
| Onboarding | None | Very important |

## Real Conversation Examples with Claude

### Example 1: New Member Onboarding

```
New member: "/onboarding"

Claude: Hello! Welcome to the Frontend Team!

        Starting onboarding.

        📋 Day 1 Checklist:

        1. ✅ Environment setup
           - Node.js 20.x installed
           - npm 9.x installed

        2. ⏳ Repository setup
           Please run these commands:
           ```bash
           npm install
           cp .env.example .env.local
           ```

        3. ⏳ Environment variable setup
           You need to set the following in .env.local:
           - DATABASE_URL
           - API_KEY

           These values are in a pinned message in #frontend-dev.

        Let me know when environment variables are set!

New member: "Setup complete!"

Claude: Great! Let's start the dev server.

        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

        ✅ Server started!
        Check at http://localhost:3000.

        📚 Next steps:
        1. Read the CLAUDE.md file (project rules)
        2. Check issues with `good-first-issue` label

        Use `/issue-start <issue number>` to start your first task!

New member: "@junior-helper What is React's useEffect?"

Claude: [Junior helper mode]

        Great question!

        🎯 One-line summary:
        useEffect defines "things to do after the component renders."

        🎭 Simple analogy:
        Like a movie theater:
        - After the movie (render) starts
        - Do additional tasks like "turn on subtitles", "dim lights"

        💻 Simple example:
        ```tsx
        function Profile({ userId }) {
          const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

          // Fetch user info whenever userId changes
          useEffect(() => {
            fetchUser(userId).then(data => setUser(data));
          }, [userId]);  // Dependency array

          return <div>{user?.name}</div>;
        }
        ```

        📝 Key points:
        1. First argument: Function to execute
        2. Second argument: Dependency array (runs when these values change)

        Want to see examples in our project?
```

### Example 2: Team PR Workflow

```
