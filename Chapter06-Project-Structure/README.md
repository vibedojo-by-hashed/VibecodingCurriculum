## 🎯 Goals for This Chapter

- Understand the **philosophy** and **reasoning** behind project folder structures
- Know the roles of important files and **why they are placed where they are**
- Compare structures across different frameworks
- Learn advanced techniques for asking Claude to explain projects
- Distinguish between good and bad structures

---

## ⏱️ Estimated Time

- Reading: **30 minutes**
- Practice: **45 minutes**

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and logged in
- Basic understanding of terminal commands (Chapter 05)

---

## 🔗 Previous Chapter Review

In Chapter 05, we learned terminal commands. With commands like `ls`, `cd`, and `mkdir`, you can now navigate folders. Now let's learn how to use this ability to understand project structures.

---

## Why Does Project Structure Matter?

Before writing code, you need to understand how a project is organized. It's like figuring out where everything is when you move into a new house.

**Real-world situations:**
- Downloaded a project from GitHub but have no idea what's what
- Don't know which file to modify
- Want to understand how the project works
- Just joined a team and need to quickly grasp the codebase

### Easy Analogy: Exploring a New House

When you move into a new house, you first figure out the layout:
- Where's the entrance (entry point)
- Where's the kitchen (core functionality)
- Where's the storage (auxiliary files)
- Which room serves which purpose (folder roles)

Projects are the same. When you know the roles of folders and files, you can quickly find what you need.

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> Project structure is a **convention among developers**.
> When there's an agreement like "components go in the components folder",
> anyone opening the project immediately knows where to find components.
> It's like how bathrooms are usually in similar locations in every house.

---

## The Philosophy of Folder Structure: Why Organize This Way?

Folder structure isn't just about organizing files. Good structure embodies a **philosophy**.

### 1. Separation of Concerns

Group code with similar responsibilities together.

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   ├── components/    # UI-related code only
│   ├── api/           # Server communication only
│   ├── styles/        # Design-related only
│   └── utils/         # Utility functions only
```

**Why do this?**
- When modifying button design, just look at the `components` folder
- When the API changes, only modify the `api` folder
- Changes in one place don't affect others

> 🔥 **Pro Tip**
>
> In practice, you'll often wonder "where should I put this file?"
> Key question: **"What is this file's main responsibility?"**
> - If it draws UI → `components`
> - If it fetches data → `api` or `services`
> - If it's a helper function used in multiple places → `utils`

### 2. Scalability

The structure shouldn't break down as the project grows.

```
# Bad example: All files in one place
src/
├── App.js
├── Button.js
├── Header.js
├── api.js
├── utils.js
├── Login.js
├── Dashboard.js
├── UserProfile.js
├── ... (100 files)

# Good example: Separated by role
src/
├── components/
│   ├── common/      # Common components
│   ├── auth/        # Auth-related
│   └── dashboard/   # Dashboard-related
├── pages/
├── api/
└── utils/
```

### 3. Discoverability

Files should be easy to find.

```
# Bad example: Names don't tell you anything
src/
├── stuff/
├── things/
├── misc/

# Good example: Names are self-explanatory
src/
├── authentication/
├── user-management/
├── payment-processing/
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> Common traps beginners fall into:
> 1. **Excessive nesting**: `src/components/ui/buttons/primary/index.js` (too deep!)
> 2. **Unclear names**: `helpers`, `misc`, `other` (can't tell what's inside)
> 3. **Inconsistency**: Some things are folders, some are files (no rules)

---

## Common Project Structure

Most web projects have a similar structure.

### Basic Web Project Structure

```
my-project/
├── src/                  # Source code (core) - code we write
│   ├── components/       # Reusable UI pieces (buttons, cards, modals, etc.)
│   ├── pages/            # Page-specific code (home, login, settings, etc.)
│   ├── styles/           # CSS style files
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions (date conversion, formatting, etc.)
│   ├── hooks/            # React custom hooks (state management logic)
│   ├── api/              # API call functions
│   └── types/            # TypeScript type definitions
├── public/               # Static files (images, icons, favicon)
├── tests/                # Test files
├── node_modules/         # Installed packages (don't touch!)
├── package.json          # Project configuration file (ID card)
├── package-lock.json     # Exact package version records
├── README.md             # Project documentation
├── .gitignore            # List of files Git should ignore
├── .env                  # Environment variables (secrets)
└── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration (if applicable)
```

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> You don't need to memorize this structure!
> Ask Claude "explain this project structure" and it will tell you.
> What's important is knowing **that structure exists**.
>
> Start by just remembering the `src` folder and `package.json`. Learn the rest when needed.

## Framework-Specific Structure Comparison

### Next.js Project (App Router)

```
nextjs-project/
├── app/                  # Pages and routing (folder = URL path)
│   ├── page.tsx          # Home page (/)
│   ├── layout.tsx        # Common layout
│   ├── about/
│   │   └── page.tsx      # /about page
│   └── api/
│       └── users/
│           └── route.ts  # /api/users API
├── components/           # UI components
├── lib/                  # Utility functions
├── public/               # Static files
└── package.json
```

**Feature**: Folder structure is URL structure! `app/about/page.tsx` = `/about` page

### React (Create React App)

```
react-project/
├── src/
│   ├── App.js            # Main app component
│   ├── index.js          # Entry point
│   ├── components/
│   ├── pages/
│   └── styles/
├── public/
│   └── index.html        # HTML template
└── package.json
```

**Feature**: `src/index.js` is the starting point, routing requires a separate library

### Vue.js Project

```
vue-project/
├── src/
│   ├── App.vue           # Main app component
│   ├── main.js           # Entry point
│   ├── components/
│   ├── views/            # Page components
│   ├── router/           # Routing configuration
│   └── store/            # State management (Vuex/Pinia)
└── package.json
```

**Feature**: Uses `.vue` extension, `views` folder serves as pages

### Python Django Project

```
django-project/
├── manage.py             # Django command execution
├── mysite/               # Project settings
│   ├── settings.py       # Overall settings
│   ├── urls.py           # URL routing
│   └── wsgi.py           # Web server settings
├── myapp/                # App (feature unit)
│   ├── models.py         # Database models
│   ├── views.py          # Request handling logic
│   ├── urls.py           # App URLs
│   └── templates/        # HTML templates
└── requirements.txt      # Package list (serves as package.json)
```

**Feature**: Separates functionality by `app` units, defines DB structure in `models.py`

> 🔥 **Pro Tip**
>
> Even with different frameworks, the **core concepts** are the same:
> - There's an entry point
> - There are components/views
> - There's routing (URL connection)
> - There are configuration files
>
> Once you learn one framework, you can quickly learn others!

## Deep Dive into Core Files

### package.json - The Project's ID Card

The most important file in every Node.js project. Contains all information about the project.

```json
{
  "name": "my-awesome-project",      // Project name
  "version": "1.0.0",                // Version number
  "description": "Todo management app", // Description
  "main": "index.js",                // Entry point file
  "scripts": {                       // Executable commands
    "dev": "next dev",               // Start dev server
    "build": "next build",           // Build for deployment
    "start": "next start",           // Start production server
    "test": "jest",                  // Run tests
    "lint": "eslint ."               // Code inspection
  },
  "dependencies": {                  // Packages needed to run
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "next": "^14.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {               // Packages needed only for development
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "eslint": "^8.0.0"
  }
}
```

**What this file tells you:**
- `name`: Project name
- `scripts`: Executable commands (`npm run dev`, etc.)
- `dependencies`: Libraries essential for the app to work
- `devDependencies`: Tools only needed during development

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> Difference between `dependencies` and `devDependencies`:
> - `dependencies`: What's needed when the app is shown to users (React, Next.js, etc.)
> - `devDependencies`: What's only needed when developers write code (ESLint, TypeScript, etc.)
>
> Think of it like a restaurant:
> - `dependencies` = Cooking ingredients (served to customers)
> - `devDependencies` = Kitchen tools (only used by chefs)

### README.md - Project Documentation

A file that explains what the project is and how to run it.

**What a good README includes:**

```markdown
# Project Name

Brief description of the project

## Installation

npm install

## Running

npm run dev

## Main Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

## Tech Stack
- React 18
- Next.js 14
- TypeScript

## Folder Structure Explanation
(Optional but very useful)
```

A good project can be started just by reading the README.

### .gitignore - List of Files to Ignore

Specifies files that shouldn't be uploaded to Git.

```gitignore
# Dependencies folder (can be recreated with npm install)
node_modules/

# Environment variables (contains secrets!)
.env
.env.local

# Build output (can be recreated with build command)
.next/
build/
dist/

# OS-generated files
.DS_Store          # macOS
Thumbs.db          # Windows

# IDE settings (personal settings, no need to share)
.vscode/
.idea/

# Log files
*.log
npm-debug.log*
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> Never upload `.env` files to Git!
> They contain sensitive information like API keys and database passwords.
> Once uploaded, it remains in the history and is very hard to completely remove.

### .env - Environment Variables File

A file that stores secret information.

```env
# Never upload to Git!

# API keys
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
SECRET_API_KEY=super-secret-key

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/mydb

# External services
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_xxxxx
```

> 🔥 **Pro Tip**
>
> Variables with the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix are accessible in the browser.
> Never add this prefix to secret keys!
>
> - `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` = Can be public (API address)
> - `SECRET_KEY` = Private (server-side only)

## Detailed Folder Role Explanation

### src/ Folder

The core folder containing **source code**.

| Folder | Role | Analogy | Example Files |
|--------|------|---------|---------------|
| `components/` | Reusable UI pieces | Lego blocks | `Button.tsx`, `Modal.tsx` |
| `pages/` | Code for each page | Chapters of a book | `Home.tsx`, `Login.tsx` |
| `styles/` | Design, colors, layout | Interior design | `globals.css`, `theme.ts` |
| `utils/` | Helper functions | Toolbox | `formatDate.ts`, `validate.ts` |
| `api/` | Code for server communication | Telephone | `userApi.ts`, `authApi.ts` |
| `hooks/` | React custom hooks | Frequently used recipes | `useAuth.ts`, `useFetch.ts` |
| `types/` | TypeScript type definitions | Blueprints | `User.ts`, `Product.ts` |
| `constants/` | Constant values | Rulebook | `routes.ts`, `messages.ts` |
| `context/` | React Context | Shared bulletin board | `AuthContext.tsx` |

### components/ Folder Organization Patterns

As projects grow, components get subdivided.

```
components/
├── common/           # Common components (used everywhere)
│   ├── Button/
│   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   ├── Button.styles.ts
│   │   └── index.ts
│   ├── Modal/
│   └── Card/
├── layout/           # Layout components
│   ├── Header/
│   ├── Footer/
│   └── Sidebar/
├── forms/            # Form-related components
│   ├── Input/
│   ├── Select/
│   └── Checkbox/
└── features/         # Feature-specific components
    ├── auth/
    │   ├── LoginForm/
    │   └── SignupForm/
    └── dashboard/
        ├── Stats/
        └── Chart/
```

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> You don't need this complexity at the start!
> If you have fewer than 10 files, just put them all in the `components/` folder.
> When files multiply and become hard to find, that's when you separate.
>
> This is called **progressive refactoring**.

### public/ Folder

Contains **static files**. Images, icons, fonts - files that don't change.

```
public/
├── images/           # Image files
│   ├── logo.png
│   └── hero-bg.jpg
├── fonts/            # Web font files
│   └── Pretendard.woff2
├── favicon.ico       # Browser tab icon
└── robots.txt        # Search engine crawler settings
```

**Feature**: Files in this folder are directly accessible via URL.
- `public/images/logo.png` → `http://localhost:3000/images/logo.png`

### node_modules/ Folder

**Never touch this!**

This folder is automatically created when you run `npm install`. It contains thousands of files, but you'll never need to modify them directly.

```
node_modules/
├── react/            # React library
├── next/             # Next.js framework
├── lodash/           # Utility library
└── ... (hundreds to thousands of folders)
```

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> - Never modify directly
> - Don't upload to Git (included in `.gitignore`)
> - Can be restored with `npm install` even if deleted
> - Very large (hundreds of MB) so shouldn't be uploaded to Git

## Good Structure vs Bad Structure

### Example of Bad Structure and Its Problems

```
bad-project/
├── app.js                # All logic in one file 😱
├── helpers.js            # Can't tell what's inside
├── stuff/                # Unclear name
│   ├── thing1.js
│   └── thing2.js
├── old_code/             # Don't know if it's used or not
├── test.js               # Test file in root
├── Button.js             # Component in root
├── styles.css            # Styles in root
└── misc/                 # All sorts of miscellaneous
```

**Problems:**
1. Hard to find where files are
2. Hard for new team members to understand
3. Confusion increases as files multiply
4. Similar files are scattered

### Example of Good Structure

```
good-project/
├── src/
│   ├── components/       # UI component collection
│   │   ├── Button/
│   │   │   ├── Button.tsx
│   │   │   ├── Button.test.tsx
│   │   │   └── Button.styles.ts
│   │   └── Modal/
│   ├── pages/            # Page components
│   ├── hooks/            # Custom hooks
│   ├── utils/            # Utility functions
│   ├── api/              # API calls
│   ├── types/            # Type definitions
│   └── constants/        # Constants
├── tests/                # E2E tests
├── public/               # Static files
├── docs/                 # Documentation
└── package.json
```

**Advantages:**
1. Can find files immediately
2. Easy for new team members to understand
3. Easy to extend
4. Tests and styles are with components

### Structure Comparison Table

| Item | Bad Structure | Good Structure |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| File location | Unpredictable | Intuitive |
| Folder names | `stuff`, `misc` | `components`, `utils` |
| Related files | Scattered | Grouped together |
| Scalability | Confusion as files grow | Systematic expansion possible |
| Tests | Don't know where they are | Next to components |

## Large-Scale Project Structure

Let's look at large-scale project structures used in real companies.

### Feature-based Structure

```
large-project/
├── src/
│   ├── features/              # Separated by feature
│   │   ├── auth/              # Authentication feature
│   │   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   │   ├── api/
│   │   │   ├── types/
│   │   │   └── index.ts
│   │   ├── dashboard/         # Dashboard feature
│   │   │   ├── components/
│   │   │   ├── hooks/
│   │   │   └── ...
│   │   ├── payment/           # Payment feature
│   │   └── user-profile/      # User profile
│   ├── shared/                # Shared code
│   │   ├── components/        # Common components
│   │   ├── hooks/             # Common hooks
│   │   └── utils/             # Common utilities
│   └── app/                   # App configuration
│       ├── routes/
│       └── providers/
```

**Advantages:**
- Features are independent units
- All code for one feature is in one place
- Teams can be assigned to specific features

> 🔥 **Pro Tip**
>
> Large-scale project structure isn't needed from the start.
>
> **Recommended progression:**
> 1. Start: Simple `src/components`, `src/pages` structure
> 2. Growth: When components exceed 30, separate into `common/`, `features/`
> 3. Expansion: Transition to feature-based structure when features get complex
>
> **YAGNI Principle**: "You Aren't Gonna Need It"
> Add it when you need it. Don't make it complex in advance.

### Monorepo Structure

A method of managing multiple projects in a single repository.

```
monorepo/
├── apps/                     # Applications
│   ├── web/                  # Web app
│   ├── mobile/               # Mobile app
│   └── admin/                # Admin app
├── packages/                 # Shared packages
│   ├── ui/                   # Shared UI components
│   ├── utils/                # Shared utilities
│   └── config/               # Shared configuration
└── package.json
```

**Use case:** When large companies like Naver or Kakao have multiple services sharing common components

## Asking Claude to Understand Projects

### Understanding Overall Structure

```
> Explain this project structure
```

Claude analyzes the folders and files and explains.

```
> What does this project do?
```

It analyzes README.md and code to tell you the purpose.

### Asking About Specific File Roles

```
> @package.json Explain this file
```

```
> @src/components/ What's in this folder?
```

### Asking How to Start

```
> How do I run this project?
```

Claude checks the scripts in package.json and guides you.

### Advanced Question Examples

```
# Understanding architecture
> Explain the data flow in this project

# Dependency analysis
> List the main libraries used in this project and their roles

# Finding entry points
> Where does this app start? What's the first code that runs?

# Understanding relationships
> Where is the UserProfile component being used?
```

## 📝 Practice Exercises

### 🟢 Beginner: Creating Project Structure

```
> Create a my-first-app folder, and inside it create src, public, and styles folders
> Also create components, pages, and utils folders inside src
```

**Expected Result:** Basic folder structure is created

### 🟡 Intermediate: Creating and Analyzing package.json

```
> Initialize npm in the my-first-app folder

> @package.json Add a scripts section to this file
> dev should be "echo starting dev server", build should be "echo building"
```

**Expected Result:** scripts are added to package.json

### 🔴 Advanced: Analyzing Existing Projects

Clone any project from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vercel/next.js.git
cd next.js
claude
```

```
> Analyze this project. What does it do?
> Tell me the 5 most important folders in this project
> What structural pattern does this project use?
```

## 🏆 Challenge Tasks

### Challenge 1: Framework Comparison Analysis

Clone 3 different framework projects and compare their structures.

```bash
# React
npx create-react-app react-sample
# Next.js
npx create-next-app nextjs-sample
# Vue
npm create vue@latest vue-sample
```

Ask Claude in each project:
```
> Analyze this project structure
> What's the entry point file?
> Where should I put components?
```

Summarize the similarities and differences.

### Challenge 2: Write Your Own Structure Guide

Create your own project structure guide.

```
> Create a folder structure guide for web development projects
> Include the role and example files for each folder
> Save it as STRUCTURE_GUIDE.md
```

## 🚨 Common Errors and Solutions

### Error 1: "node_modules is missing"

**Situation:** Downloaded a project but it won't run

**Cause:** Dependencies not installed

**Solution:**
```
> Run npm install
```

### Error 2: "Don't know which file to modify"

**Situation:** Want to change something but don't know where to look

**Solution:**
```
> Which file should I look at to change [what you want to change] in this project?
```

Example:
```
> Which file should I look at to change the main page title?
> Where do I modify to change the login button color?
```

### Error 3: "package.json is missing"

**Situation:** npm commands don't work

**Cause:** You're not in the project root, you're in a different folder

**Solution:**
```
> Where is package.json?
> Move to that folder

### Error 4: "Cannot find module" Error

**Situation:** `Cannot find module 'xxx'` error occurs

**Cause:**
- Package not installed, or
- Import path is wrong

**Solution:**
```
> Why is this error happening? [error message]
> Install the necessary packages
```

## ❌ Common Mistakes

### 1. Directly Modifying node_modules
This folder is automatically generated by `npm install`. Never modify it directly.

> ⚠️ **Why is this dangerous?**
>
> - Changes disappear on next `npm install`
> - Creates different environment from teammates
> - Makes debugging very difficult

### 2. Not Checking Project Root
Commands should be run from the project root (where package.json is).
```
> Where am I now?
```
Always check with this.

### 3. Not Reading README
Good projects have everything explained in the README. Before asking Claude:
```
> @README.md Read this for me
```

### 4. Trying to Understand Everything at Once
At first, just understand the parts you need. Don't try to understand everything.

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> The "as needed, as much as needed" strategy is effective.
>
> 1. First understand what the project does
> 2. Focus only on the part you need to modify
> 3. Only look at related files
> 4. The rest can wait until you need it

### 5. Uploading .env Files to Git

**Never do this!**

```
# Must add to .gitignore
.env
.env.local
.env.production
```

## 🖼️ Expected Screens

### Requesting Project Structure Explanation

```
> Explain this project structure

This project is a Next.js 14 based web application.

📁 Main folder structure:

src/
├── app/          # Next.js App Router (pages and routing)
│   ├── page.tsx  # Home page (/)
│   ├── layout.tsx # Common layout
│   └── api/      # API routes
├── components/   # Reusable UI components
│   ├── Header/
│   └── Button/
└── lib/          # Utility functions

📦 Main dependencies:
- React 18.2.0
- Next.js 14.0.0
- TypeScript 5.0.0

🚀 How to run:
npm run dev (development server)
npm run build (production build)
```

### Analyzing a Specific Folder

```
> @src/components/ Analyze this folder

The components folder contains 5 components:

1. Button/ - Button component with various styles
   - Button.tsx: Main component
   - Button.styles.ts: Style definitions
   - index.ts: Exports

2. Modal/ - Popup modal component
   - Includes open/close animations

3. Card/ - Card for displaying information
   - Supports image, title, description

4. Header/ - Top navigation for pages

5. Footer/ - Bottom information for pages

Pattern: Each component is in its own folder,
with related files (styles, tests) together.
```

## Mini Project: Project Explorer

Analyze any open-source project.

### 🟢 Easy: Basic Analysis

```
> What is this project?
> How do I run it?
> Tell me the 3 most important files
```

### 🟡 Medium: Understanding Structure

```
> Explain the folder structure
> Where is the main page in this project?
> What pattern are the components organized in?
> How is styling done?
```

### 🔴 Challenge: Deep Analysis

```
> List the libraries used in this project
> Where is the entry point of this project?
> Explain the data flow
> What is the architectural pattern of this project?
> Are there any structural issues that could be improved?
```

## 🆘 If It's Not Working?

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Structure doesn't make sense | Add "explain like I'm a beginner" |
| Don't know what a file is | Ask Claude "@filename what is this?" |
| Too many folders | "Just tell me the 3 most important folders" |
| Project doesn't run | "Tell me why it's not running" |
| Error message doesn't make sense | Copy the error message and ask Claude |
