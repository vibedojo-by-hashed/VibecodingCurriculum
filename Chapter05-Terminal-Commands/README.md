---

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Claude Code installed and logged in
- Basic understanding of file handling (Chapter 04)

---

## 🔗 Previous Chapter Review

In [Chapter 04](../Chapter04-Working-with-Files/README.md), we learned to reference files with `@` and create/modify/delete files. Now it's time to learn terminal commands that "bring files to life."

---

## Why Do You Need This?

Files alone don't make software work. You need to run commands to install tools, start servers, and test your code. Think of commands as the actions that bring your files to life.

**Real-world scenarios:**
- You created a website, now you want to see it in your browser
- You need to install a package to add new features
- You want to test if your code works properly
- Your code has an error and you need to debug it

### Simple Analogy: Kitchen Appliances

If files are ingredients, then terminal commands are your kitchen appliances.

```

├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                            │

│                 ingredients)               │
│  npm run dev  = Turning on the stove       │
│                 (starting to cook)         │
│  npm test     = Taste-testing (checking    │
│                 if it's good)              │
│  npm run build= Packaging (preparing for   │
│                 delivery)                  │
│                                            │
│  You don't need to know how the stove      │
│  works internally. You just need to know   │
│  "turn it on to cook."                     │
│                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

You don't need to know how the gas stove works internally. You just need to know "turn it on to cook." Same with commands—Claude knows the details, you just say what you want to happen.

## History and Importance of the Terminal

### Why is the terminal still important?

Why do we still use the terminal when we have GUI (graphical interfaces)?

| Aspect | GUI (Graphical) | CLI (Terminal) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Speed** | Mouse movement, clicking | Fast typing |
| **Automation** | Difficult | Easy with scripts |
| **Remote work** | Requires screen sharing | Works with text only |
| **Precision** | Limited | Fine-grained control |
| **Server management** | Mostly impossible | Essential |

### Why developers use the terminal

1. **Efficiency**: Same task completed faster
2. **Automation**: Repetitive tasks via scripts
3. **Server access**: Cloud servers have no GUI
4. **Tool integration**: Most dev tools support CLI
5. **Standard**: Developers worldwide use the same approach

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> Don't be afraid of the terminal!
> With Claude Code, you don't need to memorize commands.
> Just say "start the server" and that's it.

### Brief Terminal History

```
1960s: Teletype (physical typewriter)
    ↓
1970s: Terminal screens appear
    ↓
1980s: Personal computers, DOS
    ↓
1990s: Windows GUI, but developers keep using terminals
    ↓
2000s~: Web servers, cloud → terminals become more important
    ↓
Present: Execute terminal commands in natural language with AI
```

---

## Having Claude Execute Commands

Claude Code can execute terminal commands on your behalf.

### Requesting in Natural Language

```
> Show me the files in this folder
```

Claude runs the `ls` command and displays the result.

```
> Check the node version
```

Claude runs `node --version`.

```
> Show everything including hidden files
```

Claude runs `ls -la`.

### Approval Process

Claude requests confirmation before running commands:

```
Claude wants to run: ls -la
[Allow] [Deny]
```

Select `Allow` to execute.

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> You don't need to memorize terminal commands!
> Say "show me the file list" and Claude runs `ls` for you.
> Just speak in natural language.

### Immediate Execution with ! Prefix

Adding `!` runs the command immediately and shows Claude the result.

```
> !npm run build
```

Runs the build; Claude sees the result (success/failure).

```
> !git status
```

Checks git status; Claude recognizes the content.

ls -la       # Both
npm install --save-dev  # Install as dev dependency
```

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> If options confuse you, ask Claude.
> "What does --save-dev mean in npm install?"

## Understanding the npm Ecosystem

### What is npm?

npm (Node Package Manager) is a JavaScript package manager.

```

│                                            │
│  - Use code (packages) that others made    │
│  - No need to build everything from scratch│
│  - 2+ million packages shared by developers│
│    worldwide                               │
│                                            │
│  Examples:                                 │
│  - express: Create web servers             │
│  - react: Build UIs                        │
│  - lodash: Utility functions               │
│  - axios: HTTP requests                    │
│                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Simple Analogy: LEGO Blocks

```
Building from scratch:
Clay → Bricks → House (takes long)

Using npm:
Get LEGO blocks → Assemble → Done (fast)
```

### Understanding package.json

The core file of every Node.js project.

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",          // Project name
  "version": "1.0.0",            // Version
  "scripts": {                    // Runnable commands
    "dev": "vite",                // npm run dev
    "build": "vite build",        // npm run build
    "test": "vitest"              // npm test
  },
  "dependencies": {               // Packages needed to run
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "express": "^4.18.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {            // Packages needed only for development
    "typescript": "^5.0.0",
    "eslint": "^8.0.0"
  }
}
```

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> package.json is the "project description."
> - What packages are needed
> - What commands to run
> Everything is written here.

## Server Concepts and Local Development

### What is a Server?

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Server Concept                   │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                            │
│  Server = A program that receives requests │
│           and sends responses              │
│                                            │
│  [User] → Request → [Server] → Response →  │
│  [User]                                    │
│                                            │
│  Examples:                                 │
│  - Access Google → Google server sends     │
│    search page                             │
│  - Click video on YouTube → Server sends   │
│    the video                               │
│                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Local Server vs Production Server

| Category | Local Server | Production Server |
|----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Location | My computer | Cloud (AWS, GCP, etc.) |
| Access | localhost:3000 | www.example.com |
| Purpose | Development, testing | Actual service |
| Security | Only I can access | Worldwide access |

### What is localhost?

```
localhost = My own computer

localhost:3000 = Port 3000 on my computer
```

Think of port numbers as "door numbers":
- Door 3000: Development server
- Door 8080: Another server
- Door 80: Regular web (http)
- Door 443: Secure web (https)

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> Accessing `localhost:3000` is like
> "knocking on door 3000 of your computer."
> If the server is running, you get a response.
> If it's off, you can't connect.

### Running a Development Server

```bash
# Start dev server (defined in package.json scripts)
npm run dev

# When server starts, you typically see:
#   ➜  Local:   http://localhost:3000/
#   ➜  Network: http://192.168.1.100:3000/
```

**Stopping the server:**
- Press `Ctrl + C`
- Closing the terminal also stops the server

```

Or use a different port:
```
> Start the server on port 8080
```

### Error 5: "Cannot find module"

**What you see:**
```
Error: Cannot find module 'express'
```

**Cause:** Package is not installed

**Solution:**
```

## ❌ Common Mistakes

### 1. Running Commands in the Wrong Folder
```
> Where am I now?
```
Always check your location.

> ⚠️ **Warning**
>
> `npm install` must be run in the folder with package.json.
> Running it in a different folder creates a new package.json.

### 2. Not Waiting for Commands to Finish
Commands like `npm install` take time. Wait until you see the completion message.

```
In progress:
[##########........] 50%

Complete:
added 52 packages in 3s
```

### 3. Forgetting to Install Dependencies
When you first open a project:
```
> npm install
```
must be run first.

> 💡 **Beginner Tip**
>
> Always run `npm install` first when you get a new project!
> Otherwise you'll get "module not found" errors.

### 4. Closing Terminal While Server is Running
The server needs the terminal to stay open to keep running.

```
Wrong way:
Start server → Close terminal → Server stops

Right way:
Start server → Keep terminal open → Work in another terminal tab
```

### 5. Ignoring Error Messages
Copy the error message and show it to Claude. It contains useful information.

```
> Look at this error message:
> Error: Cannot find module 'lodash'
```

### 6. Overusing sudo
```
> sudo npm install  (not recommended)
```
→ If you have permission issues, find other solutions first.

### 7. Committing node_modules
```
Add node_modules to .gitignore!
```
→ It's large and can be regenerated with npm install.

---

## 🆘 If It Doesn't Work?

| Symptom | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "command not found" | Program needs to be installed |
| "permission denied" | Use `sudo` or check permissions |
| "ENOENT" | Check file/folder path |
| "port already in use" | Kill other process or change port |
| Server won't start | Check error message, verify dependencies installed |
| Not showing in browser | Check if server is running, try Ctrl+F5 to refresh |
| npm install fails | Check internet connection, delete node_modules and retry |

---
